        <p>PART I</p>
        <p>It is an ancient Mariner, </p>
        <p>And he stoppeth one of three. </p>
        <p>'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, </p>
        <p>Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,</p>
        <p>And I am next of kin;</p>
        <p>The guests are met, the feast is set:</p>
        <p>May'st hear the merry din.'</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>He holds him with his skinny hand,</p>
        <p>'There was a ship,' quoth he.</p>
        <p>'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'</p>
        <p>Eftsoons his hand dropt he.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>He holds him with his glittering eye—</p>
        <p>The Wedding-Guest stood still,</p>
        <p>And listens like a three years' child:</p>
        <p>The Mariner hath his will.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:</p>
        <p>He cannot choose but hear;</p>
        <p>And thus spake on that ancient man,</p>
        <p>The bright-eyed Mariner.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,</p>
        <p>Merrily did we drop</p>
        <p>Below the kirk, below the hill,</p>
        <p>Below the lighthouse top.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>The Sun came up upon the left,</p>
        <p>Out of the sea came he!</p>
        <p>And he shone bright, and on the right</p>
        <p>Went down into the sea.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>Higher and higher every day,</p>
        <p>Till over the mast at noon—'</p>
        <p>The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,</p>
        <p>For he heard the loud bassoon.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>The bride hath paced into the hall,</p>
        <p>Red as a rose is she;</p>
        <p>Nodding their heads before her goes</p>
        <p>The merry minstrelsy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,</p>
        <p>Yet he cannot choose but hear;</p>
        <p>And thus spake on that ancient man,</p>
        <p>The bright-eyed Mariner.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he</p>
        <p>Was tyrannous and strong:</p>
        <p>He struck with his o'ertaking wings,</p>
        <p>And chased us south along.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>With sloping masts and dipping prow,</p>
        <p>As who pursued with yell and blow</p>
        <p>Still treads the shadow of his foe,</p>
        <p>And forward bends his head,</p>
        <p>The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,</p>
        <p>And southward aye we fled.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>And now there came both mist and snow,</p>
        <p>And it grew wondrous cold:</p>
        <p>And ice, mast-high, came floating by,</p>
        <p>As green as emerald.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>And through the drifts the snowy clifts</p>
        <p>Did send a dismal sheen:</p>
        <p>Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken—</p>
        <p>The ice was all between.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>The ice was here, the ice was there,</p>
        <p>The ice was all around:</p>
        <p>It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,</p>
        <p>Like noises in a swound!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>At length did cross an Albatross,</p>
        <p>Thorough the fog it came;</p>
        <p>As if it had been a Christian soul,</p>
        <p>We hailed it in God's name.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>It ate the food it ne'er had eat,</p>
        <p>And round and round it flew.</p>
        <p>The ice did split with a thunder-fit;</p>
        <p>The helmsman steered us through!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>And a good south wind sprung up behind;</p>
        <p>The Albatross did follow,</p>
        <p>And every day, for food or play,</p>
        <p>Came to the mariner's hollo!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse small">
        <p>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,</p>
        <p>It perched for vespers nine;</p>
        <p>Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,</p>
        <p>Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse large">
        <p>'God save thee, ancient Mariner!</p>
        <p>From the fiends, that plague thee thus!—</p>
        <p>Why look'st thou so?'—With my cross-bow</p>
        <p>I shot the ALBATROSS. </p>
